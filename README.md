### Hi there, I'm Ramadhan Perkasa 👋
I'm a Frontend from Indonesia. I always love to learn new things in the world of Frontend Technology. Currently, I am focusing on exploring the profession as a Frontend developer using Javascript and Typescript programming languages. In addition to these two languages, I also occasionally learn mobile programming languages such as Dart with Flutter as the Dart Framework. More than 2 years of experience using React JS and always trying to improve my skills. I really like this fun profession of being a Frontend Developer. The green dots on my GitHub page represent my journey
